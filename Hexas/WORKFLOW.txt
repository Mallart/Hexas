Here will be described some things I need to make clear for my future self regarding the way I compute
informations and store them.

ASSEMBLY:
- An assembly descriptor file is an extended CSV file storing the informations about an assembly's 
  instruction set.
- Each assembly descriptor file should be named after the assembly's name it describes.

Edit (03/08/24):
Several assemblies can be supported (their opcodes), but their specific syntaxes and the way they are assembled
(compiled) cannot without a large data file.
Before I start adding features for specific compilation I plan on adding these compilation processes and formats:
- Portable Executable
- Executable and Linkable Format
- Mach-O
- Intel HEX
Then I'll be adding features to support any custom compiled format.
At the moment, I'm working on the PE format, and I'm willing to hardcode the behavior of my compiler for
each of these formats.
