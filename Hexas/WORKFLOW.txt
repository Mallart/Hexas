Here will be described some things I need to make clear for my future self regarding the way I compute
informations and store them.

ASSEMBLY:
- An assembly descriptor file is an extended CSV file storing the informations about an assembly's 
  instruction set.
- Each assembly descriptor file should be named after the assembly's name it describes.
